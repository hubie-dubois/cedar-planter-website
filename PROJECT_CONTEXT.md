# Planter Website Project Context

## Current State
- Site is a single-page marketing + order form flow for cedar planter boxes.
- Payment is Stripe Payment Links, quantity-based for `1-4`.
- `5+` quantity uses manual follow-up flow (no Stripe redirect).

## Order Form Behavior
- Required fields:
  - Full name
  - Phone (auto-formatted as `(###) ###-####`)
  - Email
  - Preferred contact method
  - Quantity
  - Fulfillment method (pickup or delivery)
  - Delivery address/city/zip only when delivery is selected
- Optional fields:
  - Needed by date
  - Order notes
- Needed-by date defaults to minimum lead time of 3 days in the future and enforces min date.

## Fulfillment + Pricing
- Base price: `$95` per planter.
- Delivery fee: `$10` when delivery is selected.
- Pickup:
  - Customer is informed that pickup details are shared after order.
- Delivery:
  - Limited to 25 miles of Paxton, IL.

## Stripe Logic
- Pickup Stripe links configured for quantities `1-4`.
- Delivery Stripe links configured for quantities `1-4`.
- For `5+`:
  - Form submits to Formspree.
  - Customer sees confirmation popup message.
  - Form resets.
  - Owner follows up with custom payment link.

## Form Submission
- Form endpoint:
  - `https://formspree.io/f/mlgwvadb`
- Honeypot spam field added:
  - `_gotcha`

## Map
- Leaflet map shown in order summary.
- Center: Paxton, IL (`40.4592, -88.0956`).
- Circle radius: 25 miles.
- Safari fix applied:
  - Removed Leaflet CDN integrity/crossorigin attributes.
  - Added map init retry + `window.load` fallback.

## Media / Gallery
- Hero and gallery updated to use curated images from `/Images`.
- Gallery ordered intentionally from lifestyle/install to workshop/detail shots.
